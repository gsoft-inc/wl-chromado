[[{"l":"Getting started","p":["Welcome to the Chromado documentation, a library to seamlessly integrate Chromatic+ Azure Pipelines. On this page, you'll discover how this package can optimize your workflow and learn how to set it up for your environment."]},{"l":"Features","p":["Chromado aims to provide a workflow similar to the native Chromatic GitHub integration. While it's hardly as good, it's a functional workflow until Chromatic offers a native Azure Pipelines integration."]},{"l":"Build notifications","p":["The Chromatic Azure Pipelines documentation explains how to integrate Chromatic within an existing pipeline through its CLI, but it's basically it, it lacks build notifications, it's up to you to figure out this part.","Chromado resolves this by automatically providing build notifications as pull request comments whenever a Chromatic build is completed:","Pull request notification example"]},{"l":"TurboSnap","p":["Chromado is compatible with TurboSnap and will by default trigger Chromatic builds with TurboSnap activated."]},{"l":"Squash merge","p":["Chromatic doesn't offer any mechanism to support squash merge on Azure DevOps. This means that when using Azure DevOps as a Git provider, if you wish to keep your Chromatic baselines up-to-date, you would be constrained to merging your pull requests with regular merge commits. Fortunately, Chromado implements a workflow based on Chromatic's auto-accept-changes feature, allowing pull requests to be completed with squash merges.","Here's how it works:","Whenever you create or update a pull request, a Chromatic build will automatically be triggered. If the build fails, the Chromatic pipeline will fail, and the team will need to either accept the changes or fix the issues before completing the pull request. If the changes are accepted, unfortunately the main branch baselines will not be updated.","To update the baselines of the main branch, once the pull request has been merged, a new Chromatic build will be triggered on the main branch. This new build will automatically accept all the changes (which is fine since they have been reviewed in the pull request) and update the main branch baselines."]},{"l":"Setting up your workflow","p":["First, let's create a new Chromatic project, then set up your VSCode project, and finally create an Azure pipeline."]},{"l":"Create a new Chromatic project","p":["Request the owner of the Chromatic gsoft-inc-ado organization to create a new Chromatic project for your application.

Name this new pipeline \"Chromatic\" or choose a name that best suits your project.","Add the newly created Chromatic pipeline as a required build validation for your main branch. Ensure that the build validation is required. This is crucial as any visual changes detected by Chromatic will automatically be accepted on the main branch.","Integrate the Chromatic project id and token, saved earlier, as pipeline variables of the newly created Chromatic pipeline.
