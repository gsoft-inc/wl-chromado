The following documentation is only for the maintainers of this repository.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Release the package](#release-the-package)
- [Available commands](#commands)
- [CI](#ci)

## Installation

This project uses PNPM, therefore, you must [install PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation) first:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

To install this project, open a terminal at the root of the project and execute the following command:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Setup Retype

[Retype](https://retype.com/) is the documentation platform that Squide is using for its documentation. As this project is leveraging a few [Pro features](https://retype.com/pro/) of Retype.

Everything should work fine as-is but there are a few limitations to use Retype Pro features without a wallet with a licence. If you want to circumvent these limitations, you can optionally, setup your [Retype wallet](https://retype.com/guides/cli/#retype-wallet).

To do so, first make sure that you retrieve the Retype license from your Vault (or ask IT).

Then, open a terminal at the root of the project and execute the following command:

```bash
npx retype wallet --add <your-license-key-here>
```

## Release the package

When you are ready to release the packages, you must follow the following steps:

1. Run `pnpm changeset` and follow the prompt. For versioning, always follow the [SemVer standard](https://semver.org/).
2. Commit the newly generated file in your branch and submit a new Pull Request (PR). Changesets will automatically detect the changes and post a message in your pull request telling you that once the PR closes, the versions will be released.
3. Find someone to review your PR.
4. Merge the Pull request into `main`. A GitHub action will automatically trigger and update the version of the packages and publish them to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). A tag will also be created on GitHub tagging your PR merge commit.

### Troubleshooting

#### Github

Make sure you're Git is clean (No pending changes).

#### NPM

Make sure GitHub Action has **write access** to the selected npm packages.

#### Compilation

If the packages failed to compile, it's easier to debug without executing the full release flow every time. To do so, instead, execute the following command:

```bash
pnpm build
```

By default, packages compilation output will be in their respective *dist* directory.

#### Linting errors

If you got linting error, most of the time, they can be fixed automatically using `eslint . --fix`, if not, follow the report provided by `pnpm lint`.

## Commands

From the project root, you have access to many commands. The most important ones are:

#### build

Build the library.

```bash
pnpm build
```

#### lint

Lint the files (ESLint, StyleLint and TS types).

```bash
pnpm lint
```

### changeset

To use when you want to publish a new package version. Will display a prompt to fill in the information about your new release.

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

#### clean

Clean the shell packages and the sample application (delete `dist` folder, clear caches, etc..).

```bash
pnpm clean
```

#### reset

Reset the monorepo installation (delete `dist` folders, clear caches, delete `node_modules` folders, etc..).

```bash
pnpm reset
```

#### list-outdated-deps

Checks for outdated dependencies. For more information, view [PNPM documentation](https://pnpm.io/cli/outdated).

```bash
pnpm list-outdated-deps
```

#### update-outdated-deps

Update outdated dependencies to their latest version. For more information, view [PNPM documentation](https://pnpm.io/cli/update).

```bash
pnpm update-outdated-deps
```

## CI

We use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for this repository.

You can find the configuration in the [.github/workflows](.github/workflows/) folder and the build results are available [here](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/wl-squide/actions).

We currently have 3 builds configured:

### Changesets

This action runs on a push on the `main` branch. If there is a file present in the `.changeset` folder, it will publish the new package version on npm.

### CI

This action will trigger when a commit is done in a PR to `main` or after a push to `main` and will run `build`, `lint-ci` and `test` commands on the source code.

### Retype

This action will trigger when a commit is done in a PR to `main` or after a push to `main`. The action will generate the documentation website into the `retype` branch. This repository [Github Pages](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/wl-web-configs/settings/pages) is configured to automatically deploy the website from the `retype` branch.

If you are having issue with the Retype license, make sure the `RETYPE_API_KEY` Github secret contains a valid Retype license.
